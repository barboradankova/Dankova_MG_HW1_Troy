# Historical fantasy trilogy: Troy, written by David Gammell 
Troy is a trilogy of historical fantasy novels written by David Gemmell. After the author's death in 2006, his wife Stella Gemmell completed the third book. 

David Gemmel was a British author of heroic fantasy, best known for his debut novel, Legend. A former journalist and newspaper editor, Gemmell had his first work of fiction published in 1984. He went on to write over thirty novels. Gemmell's works display violence, yet also explore themes of honour, loyalty and redemption.

Gemmell's wife Stella resolved to complete the second half of the novel Troy: Fall of Kings based upon his chapter plan and notes, and she contacted Gemmell's publisher two weeks after his funeral in order to make the offer. The book was published in 2007 under the joint authorship of David and Stella Gemmell.

It is a reimagining of the Trojan War period and features characters and settings from Homer's Iliad. The main characters are Helikaon (Aeneas), Andromache and Odysseus.
